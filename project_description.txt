1. Project Overview
A text-based address book application that runs in the console, letting users manage their personal contacts through a simple menu-driven interface.

2. Core Functionalities
Add a Contact
Prompt the user for fields such as first name, last name, phone number, email address, postal address, and an optional notes field.
Validate required fields (e.g. phone number format, non‐empty names).
View All Contacts
Display a numbered list of all stored contacts in a readable tabular form (e.g. “1. Smith, John – (555) 123-4567”).
Search Contacts
Allow searching by any attribute (e.g. last name, phone substring, email domain).
Show matching results or “no matches found” message.
Edit a Contact
Let the user pick a contact by its list number or unique ID, then update individual fields.
Delete a Contact
Confirm before removal, then delete from the in-memory store.
Persist & Load
On startup, load existing contacts from a file (e.g. CSV or serialized objects).
On exit or after each change, save the current state back to that file so data isn’t lost between runs.
Exit
Gracefully terminate the program, ensuring any unsaved changes are written to disk.

3. Non-Functional Considerations
Input Validation & Error Handling
Handle invalid menu choices (e.g. letters where numbers are expected).
Catch file I/O errors and show user-friendly messages.
User Experience
Clear prompts, confirmations for destructive actions, and concise success/failure feedback.
Extensibility
Design so new fields (birthday, company, tags) or features (grouping, favorites) can be added without rewriting core logic.

4. Suggested High-Level Components
Contact: a simple data class holding all contact fields.
ContactBook: manages a collection of Contact objects (add, remove, search, sort).
StorageManager: handles reading from/writing to file.
ConsoleUI: presents the menu, reads user input, invokes ContactBook and StorageManager methods, and displays results.

5. Stretch Goals
Sorting & Paging: sort by last name or paginate long lists.
Import/Export: support CSV import or vCard export.
Birthday Reminders: flag and list upcoming birthdays.
Tagging & Filtering: let users assign tags (e.g. “work”, “family”) and filter by them.
